    "The BikeEase advertisement generation system demonstrates how Generative AI can create persuasive, branded marketing content with minimal manual effort.  \n",
    "- Dolly-v2-3B delivered the most creative and engaging results.  \n",
    "- The pipeline is flexible: inputs can be adjusted for different bike specs, offers, and audiences.  \n",
    "- This system saves time while maintaining brand consistency, achieving the project‚Äôs goal of automated marketing through LLMs.\n",
    "- I struggled a litte with compute in that I had to cancel some of my trials because they were taking too long.\n",
    "- But I still learned alot about how these work and will continue to try new things when I have more time.\n"
